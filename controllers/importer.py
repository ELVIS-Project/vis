def import_piece(file_path):
    """
    Import a music21-supported symbolic notation file and find its title and the part names.

    NB: the reason we freeze the music21 Score is because normally music21 Streams are complex
    webs of weak references, which cannot be pickled and therefore cannot be passed between
    different child processes in a multiprocessing context.

    NB2: if the imported file is a MIDI file, it won't be pickled, because that doesn't work in the
    currently-available version of music21. It will be fixed with music21 1.6.0
    **** When you fix this, you have to also update the automated tests.

    Parameters
    ----------

    file_path : string
        The pathname of the file to try to import.

    Returns
    -------

    list of tuples

            [(file_path, string_describing_the_error)]
        If the file imported as an Opus (i.e., more than one Score is held in the file), then each
        Score is appended to the file.
