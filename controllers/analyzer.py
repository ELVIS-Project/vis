    Find events in parts.

    The 'parts' argument is a list of at least one music21 Part object

    The 'settings' argument must be an AnalysisSettings object with all the following settings:
    - types : a list of 2-tuples, where element 0 is a type you want to count as an "event,"
                and element 1 is a function that produces a string version suitable for an
                AnalysisRecord instance.
    - offset : the minimum quarterLength offset between consecutive events
    - salami : if True, all events will be the offset distance from each
        other, even if this produces a series of identical events

    The 'record' argument is an AnalysisRecord object to use for recording this analysis.

    This method is intended to analyze more than one part, finding
    simultaneous occurrences of "events," as determined by whether a thing
    in the part is an instance of one of the classes or types supplied.

    The method checks at every offset that is divisisble by "offset" without
    remainder. If "salami" is True, every such offset will have an event--if
    no new event has happened, the previous event is repeated. If "salami" is
    False, no events will be repeated, leading to unequal offset intervals
    between consecutive events in the AnalysisRecord.

    If given only one Part object, event_finder() acts essentially like an
    overly-complicated filter.

    This method should only be called from the Analyzer.analyze_pieces() method,
    which coordinates multiprocessing.
