    Hold settings relevant to performing experiments.

    All the possible settings:
    - experiment : name of the experiment to use
    - quality : whether or not to display interval quality
    - simple or compound : whether to use simple or compound intervals
    - topX : display on the "top X" number of results
    - threshold : stop displaying things after this point
    - values of n : a list of ints that is the values of 'n' to display
    - sort order : whether to sort things 'ascending' or 'descending'
    - sort by : whether to sort things by 'frequency' or 'name'
    - output format : choose the Display subclass for this experiment's results
    - lilypond helper : the Experiment that will help produce annotated results for
        LilyPondExperiment. Consequently, this is only used by that Experiment.
    - ignore direction : (boolean) whether to ignore directions, which means to represent all
        negative intervals as positive ones, and that voice crossing is ignored in interval n-grams
    - annotate these : (list of str) These are the objects to be annotated on a targeted LilyPond
        output score
