This module presents the NGram class, representing a list of musical objects
that are optionally connected by other musical objects.

The IntervalNGram subclass is for vertical intervals connected by horizontal
intervals of the lower voice; this is a contrapuntal module.

The ChordNGram subclass is for chords connected by neo-Riemannian
transformations.
